	<h4>About</h4>
	<p style="font-size:16px;">

	  LCG by Fantasy Flight Games. The source code is available on
	  <a href="https://github.com/seastan/seastan.github.io">Github</a>.

      <li style="list-style-image: url('images/spheres/7fellowship.png');"><h4>Builder</h4>
	<p style="font-size:16px;">
	  The deck builder was built by Dirk Meijer, and is maintained over at <a href="http://ddddirk.github.io/lotrdb/">The Rivendell Councilroom</a>. The deck builder represents a large portion of the code for Love of Tales, and this website would likely not exist without Dirk's deckbuilder. You can buy him a drink here:

	<p style="font-size:16px;">
	  To build a deck, simply search for the card you want to add using the options on the left of the builder page, and click the button indicating the number of copies you would like to add. You can name and save the deck using the textbox and button in the top-right, and it will then be saved to the cloud and accessible from any device.
	  Suggestions will appear as you are building your deck. These can be hidden using the button at the top of the suggestions column. The suggestion algorithm is continuously in development, so some strange suggestions may appear. Individual suggestions can be blocked by clicking the X next to the suggested card. The list of blocked suggestions is reset when the page is refreshed or when the 'Clear Blocked Suggestions' button is clicked.

      <li style="list-style-image: url('images/spheres/7fellowship.png');">
	<h4>Sets</h4>
	<p style="font-size:16px;">
	  In the Sets tab, you can select which sets you own. Only cards from
	  these sets will show up in the Builder tab. The packs you've selected
	  are stored in your browser data and will be remembered for subsequent
	  visits to the deckbuilder, but may need to be re-selected when moving
	  to a different device.
	</p>
	<br>
      <li style="list-style-image: url('images/spheres/7fellowship.png');">
	<h4>My Decks</h4>
	<p style="font-size:16px;">
	  In My Decks tab, you can view the decks you've made (or are still working
	  on) and load decks you've made in the past. Beware that loading
	  or uploading decks will <b>overwrite the current deck in the builder without prompt</b>,
	  so save your deck before loading another deck (or open up a new tab in your browser), or it will be lost.
	  <br><br>
	  Saved decks can be downloaded, either in a text file that contains markup
	  for both Reddit (MarkDown) and BoardGameGeek (BBCode) or as an OCTGN deck.
	  Decks can also be uploaded. Note that uploading <b>Does not
	    automatically save the deck</b>, it only loads it into the Builder.
	  <br><br>
	  These decks are stored on the cloud and are accessible by any device connected to the internet.
	  To interact with a deck, click on it to highlight it, then click on one of the buttons. You 
	  can export the deck to text format or OCTGN format, load the deck into the builder,
	  or open up the info page for the deck.
	  <br><br>
	  <b>Deleting decks:</b> Decks can be deleted, as long as they have not yet been referenced. For example, 
	  If you (or anyone else) logs a quest with your deck, that log now links to the deck and will prevent 
	  the deck from being deleted. Or if you modify your deck and make an update version, that new version
	  will also link back to the original, and will prevent the original from being deleted. If you attempt
	  to delete a deck that cannot be deleted, you will be offere the choice to tranfer it to your archive instead.
	</p>
	<br>
      <li style="list-style-image: url('images/spheres/7fellowship.png');">
	<h4>My Logs</h4>
	<p style="font-size:16px;">
	  In the My Logs tab, you log a quest. You must input a Date, the quest you completed,
	  whether it was a Success or Failure, the score, and at least one deck ID. Deck IDs can
	  be found in the My Decks tab or in the url for the Deck Info page for a deck.
	  
	  Once you save a log it will appear in the 'My Logs' section with links to the decks used
	  to beat the quest.

      <li style="list-style-image: url('images/spheres/7fellowship.png');">
	<h4>Community</h4>
	<p style="font-size:16px;">
	  In the Community tab, you can perform a search on all the decks in the database. You can
	  search using a portion of the deck title, or search for decks that have beaten a specific quest.
	  You can search for decks that contain the card that is currently being displayed in the 
	  card preview in the sidebar. You can also limit the results to only show decks that can be built
	  using the sets you've selected over in the 'Sets' tab.
